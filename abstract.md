The aim of this project is to provide a user-friendly SQL learning environment for SQL beginners. 
The core objective of the tool is to assess the user’s attempts at SQL questions and deliver helpful feedback to aid in learning the language. This feedback mainly focuses on the construction of the query attempt and uses the query result to determine whether the user has garnered the correct result table. 
The Lark Python library is used to deconstruct the user’s query. It is a parsing library that uses a defined context-free grammar to parse through the query and gather data regarding the various clause types, which will then be compared against a model query provided by the instructor’s solution file. 
The tool has a virtual ‘workbook’ structure whereby each user may create an account, and, upon login, is presented with a series of workbooks, each containing a separate set of questions. These workbooks are uploaded by an instructor using a questions file, a corresponding solutions file, workbook name and an SQL database. Details of these workbooks are stored in an SQL table and are fetched upon start-up to be displayed to the user in a Flask web application.
